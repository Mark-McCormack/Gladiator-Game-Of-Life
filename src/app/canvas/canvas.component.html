    <h1>Gladiator Game of Life</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the <strong>Gladiator Game of Life</strong>, an interactive
      simulation inspired by Conway’s <em>Game of Life</em>. This project
      explores how two competing groups of cells evolve and battle for survival
      under predefined rules. You can control the board manually or let it run
      automatically using the AI-driven simulation.
    </p>

    <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
    <p>
      The game is based on a grid where each cell can be either
      <strong>alive</strong> or <strong>dead</strong>. The cells follow simple
      survival rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cells with too few neighbors die from isolation.</li>
      <li>Cells with too many neighbors die from overpopulation.</li>
      <li>
        Dead cells can become alive if surrounded by the right number of living
        neighbors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this version, the board is split into two competing teams:
      <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">Red</span> and
      <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Blue</span>. Each team fights
      for dominance based on the rules of cellular automata.
    </p>

    <h3>Game Controls</h3>
    <p>Use the following buttons to interact with the game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Set the Board!</strong> – Generates a new randomized board with
        Red and Blue cells.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Move the Board!</strong> – Advances the game by one step.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loop the Board!</strong> – Starts or stops an automatic loop
        that continuously updates the board.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wipe the Board!</strong> – Clears the board, resetting it for a
        new simulation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI-Powered Features</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to manual control, the project includes an
      <strong>AI model</strong> that can analyze board states and predict
      potential outcomes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Search Depth</strong> – Adjusts how many turns ahead the AI
        should analyze.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cell Spawn Rate</strong> – Controls how densely populated the
        board is at the start.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Train AI</strong> – Runs a machine learning model to improve
        predictions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Predict Outcome</strong> – Uses AI to estimate which team is
        likely to win.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI Training Progress</h3>
    <p>
      When the AI is training, a progress bar will appear, showing the status.
      Training logs are available in the console for debugging.
    </p>

    <p>Enjoy the simulation and may the best team survive!</p>
